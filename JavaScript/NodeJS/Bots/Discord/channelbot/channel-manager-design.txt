Channel Array:
	Holds all permanent and temporary channels - DONE
	Creates perm channels if they don't exist on startup - MAYBE NOT POSSIBLE
	Deletes all channels not in the array if they are empty on startup - DONE
	Adds all non-empty channels in the array to the array on startup (assumes they are temp) - KIND OF DONE
	Holds creator of all channels - DONE I THINK

User creates a temp channel:
	Bot creates physical channel - DONE
	Channel is added to array - DONE
		has type temp, obviously - DONE
	If the user who creates the channel is not in voice, they must join it within 30s or it is deleted
		Possibly add an "activated" flag (0/1) to the channel in the array
	If the user who creates the channel IS in voice, they are moved to the new channel

On user joining any voice channel:
	add them to the text channel for the voice channel.

On user leaving any voice channel:
	Check if the remaining users is 0
	If so, check if the channel is temp
	If both conditions are true, DELETE THE Channel

There MUST be a command to modify the channel array (add new perm channels as an admin)
Also a add a command for getting the user ID/name of a person

@MineplexBot channel temp "name"
@MineplexBot channel perm "name"
startsWith("perm") or startsWith("perm")

Roles

When a user creates a temp channel:
	A new role is created for that channel (maybe <channel>-mngr) which allows them to manage the channel.
